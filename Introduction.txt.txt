There is a story behind this project,one of my freind is a rap artist and have some grear videos on youtube so one day he said to me that as you are learning data analysis technique so can you give me
a brief statistics of my youtube video's data and i was like why not? so i just give him a satistical description of his youtube videos data along with their visualization.
			Thats it here my story ends!! hahahaha i know its bad..


So this project for anyone who wants to analyze youtube videos data of a particular artist or anyone having interest in mining youtube data..you just simply chnage the name of the artist in the script and you get the results.

You can also predict the likes on an upcoming video of a particular artist on the basis of how much time a video got viewed..
